# RapidResQ ðŸš’ðŸ”¥
RapidResQ is a firefighter-focused GIS mapping app built in C++ (ECE297, UofT). Features include hydrant/building/weather layers, night mode, A routing, and optimization. Designed for speed, clarity, and split-second decision making. (Docs only)

> **Note**: This repository documents the project only. **Source code is not included** per course policy.

## Overview
RapidResQ is an emergency response tool that gives firefighters **fast, clear, and reliable** access to the information they need under pressure. Built for **ECE297 (Software Design & Communication, University of Toronto)**, it combines a **usability-first map UI** with **routing and optimization algorithms** to support splitâ€‘second decisions.

Our mission: **help first responders prepare, act, and respond with confidence.**

## Features
### ðŸ”‘ Usability & UI
- **Layer Toggles**: Quickly show/hide weather, hydrants, and building heights.
- **Night Mode**: Improves readability in low light and while driving.
- **High-Contrast Icons & Colours**: Distinguish hydrants, POIs, and building layers at a glance.
- **Dynamic Level of Detail (LOD)**: Zoom-based rendering (highways â†’ hydrants) cuts visual clutter.
- **Scale Bar & Legends**: Better spatial awareness for preâ€‘planning.
- **Survey-Validated**: Usability survey returned a **91% score**.

### ðŸš° Critical Data Layers
- **Fire Hydrants**: Locations with details (pressure, type, water source).
- **Buildings**: Heights and material context for vertical access planning.
- **Weather**: Contextual data for attack strategy (wind, precipitation, etc.).

### ðŸ§­ Smart Navigation
- **Autocomplete Search**: Real-time suggestions for addresses/streets.
- **A* Pathfinding**: Fast, optimal routing tuned for emergency response.

### âš¡ Optimization
- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**: Generates strong initial routes.
- **2â€‘Opt & Orâ€‘Opt**: Local refinements to decrease overall travel time.
- **Multithreading**: Improves responsiveness under heavier loads.
- **Render Efficiency**: **25â€“50%** reduced render times; typical frame under **100 ms**.

### ðŸ”¥ Fire Spread Simulation *(Planned)*
Predictive model using **wind, weather, terrain, and materials** to highlight **highâ€‘risk zones** and improve evacuation and containment planning.
